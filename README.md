## Notes

Understanding the Java syntax and commands was brand-new to me, so it was difficult to understand exactly what each like of code did.
However, the comments were very helpful in figuring out what each line did in relation to others.
All the moving pieces of this project were also a new concept, as well as the "edit_item.xml" sections that involved both the design and the code for each piece of the app.
ALSO FIGURING OUT GITHUB WAS SO DIFFICULT (probably the hardest part of the project)
